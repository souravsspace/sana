		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Extension and Migration Setup",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the existing subtasks further, focusing on detailed implementation steps for each schema definition, constraint application, and migration testing phase.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational and high-impact. It involves defining multiple new schemas, extending an existing one, handling relationships (FKs, cascading deletes), unique constraints, and the critical process of migrations (forward, rollback, data integrity). Drizzle ORM simplifies some aspects, but migration management is always sensitive and requires careful testing. The existing 5 subtasks are well-defined and cover the core aspects."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "tRPC Authentication Middleware and Router Structure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks covering JWT validation, user context attachment, base router setup, Zod integration, and comprehensive error handling for authentication.",
			"reasoning": "This task establishes the security foundation and API structure. It requires understanding of authentication flows (JWT validation, token expiration), tRPC context, and robust error handling for unauthorized access. It's a critical dependency for almost all subsequent API tasks and needs to be implemented securely and scalably."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "User Profile Management and Username System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for defining Zod schemas, implementing backend tRPC procedures for profile and username checks, developing the frontend profile form with real-time validation, and addressing uniqueness considerations.",
			"reasoning": "While basic CRUD is straightforward, the username system adds significant logic: validation rules (format, length, reserved words), uniqueness checks (which can have race conditions), and the implication for public URLs. The real-time availability check also adds frontend complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Dashboard Layout and Navigation Structure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for designing and implementing the base dashboard layout, responsive navigation, integrating navigation items, implementing logout, and displaying user profile information.",
			"reasoning": "This is a substantial frontend UI task involving multiple components, responsiveness across devices, and state management for navigation. It also includes the important 'logout' functionality which involves token cleanup and redirection, making it more than just static UI."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Basic Link Page CRUD Operations",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for defining Zod schemas, implementing tRPC procedures for list, create, update, and delete (including slug generation/uniqueness and delete strategy), and developing the necessary frontend components for display and forms.",
			"reasoning": "This is a core CRUD task, but the slug generation with conflict resolution and the decision/implementation of soft vs. cascade delete add a layer of complexity beyond simple data manipulation. Ensuring user isolation (users can only access their pages) is also critical."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Public Link Page Rendering System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for setting up the public route and data fetching, developing the public page components, integrating SEO, implementing error handling, developing a basic theme system, and setting up caching for performance.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves public-facing rendering, which implies careful attention to SEO (meta tags, Open Graph), performance (caching), and robust error handling for external users (non-existent usernames, private pages). The 'basic theme system' also adds another layer of implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Link Management System within Pages",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for defining Zod schemas, implementing tRPC procedures for link CRUD and reordering, developing frontend components for link display and editing (including thumbnail upload), and implementing drag-and-drop reordering with optimistic updates.",
			"reasoning": "While link CRUD is simple, the 'reordering functionality' with drag-and-drop, optimistic updates, and `sortOrder` management is a non-trivial UI/UX and backend synchronization challenge. Thumbnail upload also adds file handling complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Live Preview and Page Management Features",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for developing the real-time page preview, implementing page duplication and archive/unarchive features, creating the page settings modal, and displaying basic analytics.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines several distinct features: real-time preview (which requires careful state management and potentially debouncing/throttling updates), page duplication (involving copying data), and analytics summary (requiring data aggregation). Each sub-feature adds its own layer of complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Polar.sh Subscription Integration and Webhook Handling",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for setting up the Polar.sh API client, implementing tRPC procedures for checkout and subscription management, developing the webhook endpoint with signature verification, implementing robust subscription status synchronization logic, and setting up comprehensive testing.",
			"reasoning": "External API integration, especially for payments/subscriptions, is inherently complex and high-risk. Webhook handling requires robust security (signature verification), comprehensive error handling, and retry logic. This is a critical business function with financial implications, demanding meticulous implementation and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Feature Gating and Billing Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for designing and implementing the feature gating utility, integrating it across the application, developing the SubscriptionCard and PricingTable components, building the billing dashboard UI, and implementing the upgrade/downgrade and cancellation flows.",
			"reasoning": "Feature gating needs to be robustly implemented throughout the application to ensure correct access control. The billing dashboard involves displaying sensitive financial information and handling complex upgrade/downgrade flows, which often include proration logic, making it a critical and intricate business feature."
